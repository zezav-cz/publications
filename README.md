- [Distributed block and object storages](https://pub.zezav.cz/distributed_block_and_object_storages.pdf)
    > This document explores the evolution and categorization of storage solutions, focusing on the shift from traditional systems to modern distributed storage architectures. It highlights key types of storage—block storage, file systems, and object storage—and their respective use cases, advantages, and challenges. The need for distributed storage is addressed through scalability, fault tolerance, and performance considerations, with emphasis on architectural concepts like storage pools, replication, erasure coding, and scalability strategies. The paper also provides an overview of practical implementations, offering insights into the design and functionality of modern storage systems.
